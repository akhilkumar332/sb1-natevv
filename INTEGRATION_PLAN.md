## Integration Priority

### Priority 1: Core Data Fetching (Critical)
1. Replace all mock data with Firestore queries
2. Implement real-time listeners for live updates
3. Add loading states and error handling

### Priority 2: User Actions (High)
1. Implement create, update, delete operations
2. Add form validations
3. Implement success/error notifications

### Priority 3: Advanced Features (Medium)
1. Analytics charts integration
2. Export functionality
3. Real-time notifications
4. Advanced filtering and search

### Priority 4: Polish (Low)

## Implementation Approach

Due to the large scope, I will:
1. Create integrated hook files for each dashboard
2. Update dashboards one by one
3. Ensure all relationships work end-to-end
4. Test complete user flows

This will be implemented in phases to ensure quality and functionality.
